The purpose of this repositry is to store blogs for sharing ideas on how to make theory and application of machine learning and it's tools easy. I am starting this with a blog sharing my ideas on how to kick start using tensorflow without reading too much of tensorflow's documentation. Tensorflow is huge so better start using it than reading it. In this blog, it's shown how to make variabels, create it's summary, read in data and play with this data. In the next, an exciting application of neural nets using tensorflow will be shown.
